# tichu-card-detection
Generating a dataset of Tichu playing cards to train a neural net. Taking [geaxgx's work](https://github.com/geaxgx/playing-card-detection) and applying it to the Tichu card playing game.

This dataset can be used for the training of a neural net intended to detect/localize playing cards. It was used on the project __[Playing card detection with YOLO v3](https://youtu.be/pnntrewH0xg)__

## Changes
The notebook **creating_playing_cards_dataset.ipynb** is a guide through the creation of a dataset of playing cards.
 - The script was modified to extract card iamges from pictures of cards instead of from videos.
